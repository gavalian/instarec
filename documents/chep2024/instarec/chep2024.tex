Charged track reconstruction is a pivotal task in nuclear physics experiments, enabling the detection and analysis of particles generated in high-energy collisions. Machine learning (ML) has proven to be a transformative tool in this domain, overcoming challenges such as intricate detector geometries, high event multiplicities, and noisy data. While traditional methods like the Kalman filter have been widely used for pattern recognition, ML approaches—including neural networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)—offer enhanced accuracy and scalability.
In this presentation, we share our findings on leveraging AI to aid data reconstruction for identifying charged tracks in the Drift Chambers of the CLAS12 detector. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CNN) is employed to de-noise the drift chamber data, while a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network identifies track candidates from the segments reconstructed in each layer. This AI-driven track identification results in approximately a $60\%$ increase in statistics for multiparticle inclusive states. Additionally, we developed a neural network to predict particle parameters directly from raw Drift Chamber hits, enabling full event reconstruction at a rate of approximately 20 kHz, surpassing the experimental data acquisition speed. These advancements are redefining the application of AI in experimental physics and transforming the methodologies of nuclear physics experiments in the era of streaming readout.

\section{Introduction}
\indent
Nuclear physics experiments have grown increasingly complex over recent decades, featuring more sophisticated detector systems and higher luminosities. In new experiments with elevated detector occupancies, innovative approaches to data processing are essential to enhance both the accuracy and speed of data reconstruction. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising alternatives to traditional algorithms, with Machine Learning (ML) techniques being utilized at various stages of experimental data processing, including detector reconstruction, particle identification, detector simulations, and physics analysis.

This paper explores the integration of machine learning models into the CLAS12 charged-particle track reconstruction software. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the reconstruction performance, highlighting improvements in track reconstruction efficiency and processing speed compared to conventional methods.


\section{CLAS12 Detector}

The CLAS12 (CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer for 12 GeV) detector is a state-of-the-art experimental apparatus used in nuclear physics research. It is located at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, Virginia. The detector is part of an upgrade to the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), which increased the maximum energy of the electron beam from 6 GeV to 12 GeV. This upgrade allows for a more in-depth exploration of the structure and properties of nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the nature of the strong force that binds them together in the atomic nucleus.

  followed by the torus magnet (gray), the drift chamber tracking system (light blue),
  and time-of-flight scintillation counters (brown), and electromagnetic calorimeters (red). }

Key features and capabilities of the CLAS12 detector include:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\bf Large Acceptance: } As its name suggests, CLAS12 has a large angular and momentum acceptance. This feature is crucial for detecting particles over a wide range of angles and energies, allowing comprehensive analysis of nuclear reactions.
\item{\bf Electron Beam Experiments:} CLAS12 is designed to investigate the interactions of high-energy electrons with nucleons and nuclei. By scattering electrons off target materials, scientists can probe the internal structure of nucleons and the dynamics of the strong force.
\item{\bf High Luminosity:} The detector operates at high luminosities, enabling it to collect a vast amount of data from electron scattering experiments. This high data rate is essential for studying rare processes and achieving statistically significant results.
\item{\bf Sophisticated Detection Systems:} CLAS12 consists of various subsystems designed to detect different types of particles and measure their properties. These include drift chambers for tracking charged particles, time-of-flight counters for particle identification, calorimeters for measuring energy, and Cherenkov detectors for identifying electrons.
\item{\bf Versatility:} The detector is versatile and can be used for a wide range of experiments, from studying the quark-gluon structure of nucleons to investigating the properties of nuclei under extreme conditions.
\item{\bf Data Analysis and Simulation:} Advanced software and computational tools are used to analyze the data collected by CLAS12. These tools include simulation packages that model the detector's response and data analysis frameworks for extracting physical quantities from the experimental data.
\end{itemize}
In summary, CLAS12 is a critical tool in modern nuclear physics, enabling researchers to delve deeper into the quantum world of nucleons and nuclei. Its advanced technology and capabilities contribute significantly to our understanding of fundamental physics, particularly in the realm of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory describing the strong interaction.


\section{Drift Chamber Particle Tracking}

The CLAS12~\cite{Burkert:2020akg} forward detector is built around a six-coil toroidal magnet 
which divides the active detection area into six azimuthal regions, called ``sectors''. Each sector is 
equipped with three regions of drift chambers~\cite{Mestayer:2020saf} designed to detect charged 
particles produced by the interaction of an electron beam with a target. Each region consists of two 
chambers (called super-layers), each of them having six layers of wires. Each layer  in a super-layer 
contains 112 signal wires, making a super-layer a $6\times112$ cell matrix. 
The schematic view of all sectors and super-layers is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:drift_chambers}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.32\columnwidth]{images/evt_05.pdf}

\includegraphics[width=0.32\columnwidth]{images/evt_35.pdf}
\caption{Example views of the six sectors of the Drift Chambers of CLAS12. The points show wire hits for each of the layers in the drift chambers and the lines indicate reconstructed tracks by the conventional CLAS12 tracking algorithm. } 
\label{fig:drift_chambers}
\end{figure}

Particles that originate from the interaction vertex travel through the magnetic field and pass through all 
three regions of the drift chambers in a given sector and are reconstructed by tracking algorithms. First, 
in each super-layer adjacent wires with a signal are grouped into segments. Track candidates are constructed 
by connecting segments in each super-layer to form a track trajectory. Then each track candidate is fitted through 
a magnetic field to calculate the quality of the track ($\chi^2$), and the track candidates with $\chi^2$ below the cut value
are saved for further refinement using Kalman-filter~\cite{Kalman1960}.

The positions of these segments in each super-layer are used to fit the track trajectory 
to derive initial parameters, such as momentum and direction (called "hit-based" tracking).  After the initial selection, good track candidates 
(shown in Figure~\ref{fig:drift_chambers} with lines) are passed through a Kalman-filter to 
refine measured parameters further (called "time-based" tracking).

At the first stage of the tracking, the tracks are identified using only the hit positions (wire number). The precision 
of the reconstructed track parameters using only hit positions are worse ($\sim3\%$) than the final calculated parameters from time-based tracking, but they are sufficient to calculate physics quantities from the event and identify desired reactions in the event. 

The CLAS12 track reconstruction process is already making use of AI at different stages.
First, a Convolutional
Autoencoder is used to de-noise the drift chamber hits~\cite{Thomadakis:2022zcd}, which leads to improved cluster
identification in each super-layer. Then after the clustering, the track candidates are identified using a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier,
which identifies 6-super-layer and 5-super-layer track candidates~\cite{Gavalian:2020oxg}. The combined result of
de-noising and AI-assisted track candidate identification used in CLAS12 leads to an increase in statistics of multi-particle 
final states of $50\%-75\%$ depending on kinematics~\cite{Gavalian:2020xmc}. 
Furthermore, an Artificial Intelligence approach to track reconstruction was developed to estimate track parameters 
(such as momentum and direction) based on cluster positions of the track~\cite{Thomadakis:2023ebe}, it was shown that 
the AI-estimated track parameters are closer to the values reconstructed using the Kalman-filter than the 
conventional hit-based tracking.

The developed AI tools for CLAS12 reconstruction can identify tracks from their cluster pattern and estimate the track parameters.
If combined with the clustering algorithm, this chain may provide a complete track reconstruction solely based on AI algorithms and
may potentially be used in real-time with data acquisition.
